## Warning: This project is still in it's early days, and I'm currently busy with other stuff which makes me unable to continue working on it at this moment


# Language Framework
The language framework makes it possible to create a programming language with as little knowledge on how to do it and with almost to no experince with programming. All of this while still offering a high level of customizability allowing multiple programming languages to take form with no similarity to them!!

The only thing you (the end user) need to do is to make the changes that you want in your programming language to the file `custom.hpp` and compile the project!
